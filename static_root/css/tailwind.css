/* FreshCart/staticfiles/css/tailwind.css
   This file would typically be generated by running the Tailwind CSS CLI:
   npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./staticfiles/css/tailwind.css --watch

   For this prototype, the Tailwind CDN is used in base.html for simplicity.
   If you set up a build process, the compiled CSS would go here.
*/

/* You would typically put custom CSS here that cannot be expressed with Tailwind classes */
/* Or, if using a build process, this file would contain your @tailwind directives */
/* Example: */
/* @tailwind base; */
/* @tailwind components; */
/* @tailwind utilities; */
